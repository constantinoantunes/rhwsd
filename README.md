R interface to the Harmonized World Soil Database
=================================================

This is a wrapper package containing the HWSD and helper functions

## How Data were imported:

1. Download [HWSD_RASTER.zip](http://webarchive.iiasa.ac.at/Research/LUC/External-World-soil-database/HWSD_Data/HWSD_RASTER.zip) from [HWSD](http://webarchive.iiasa.ac.at/Research/LUC/External-World-soil-database/HTML/HWSD_Data.html?sb=4) and extract.


```r
system("wget http://webarchive.iiasa.ac.at/Research/LUC/External-World-soil-database/HWSD_Data/HWSD_RASTER.zip")
require(raster)
hwsd <- raster("</path/to>/HWSD_RASTER/hwsd.bil")
proj4string(hwsd) <- "+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0"
save(hwsd, file = "hwsd.RData")
```


## A quick example:


```r
library(rhwsd)
lat <- 44
lon <- -80
gridsize <- 0.1
bbox <- get.bbox
ans <- extract.one(bbox = c(44, 44.5, -88.5, -88))
```
