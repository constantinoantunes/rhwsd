R interface to the Harmonized World Soil Database
=================================================

Forked from https://github.com/dlebauer/rhwsd/

This is a wrapper package containing the HWSD and helper functions

Code:

    Based on "Technical note: Processing the Harmonized World Soil Database (Version 1.2) in R" By D G Rossiter Dec 7, 2012 ([available online](http://www.itc.nl/~rossiter/teach/R/R_HWSD.pdf), with copy in the rwhsd package `man` folder).

## How Data were imported:

1. Download [HWSD_RASTER.zip](http://webarchive.iiasa.ac.at/Research/LUC/External-World-soil-database/HWSD_Data/HWSD_RASTER.zip) from [HWSD](http://webarchive.iiasa.ac.at/Research/LUC/External-World-soil-database/HTML/HWSD_Data.html?sb=4) and extract.


```r
system("wget http://webarchive.iiasa.ac.at/Research/LUC/External-World-soil-database/HWSD_Data/HWSD_RASTER.zip")
require(raster)
hwsd <- raster("</path/to>/HWSD_RASTER/hwsd.bil")
proj4string(hwsd) <- "+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0"
save(hwsd, file = "hwsd.RData")
```

## How to install

```r

library(devtools)

install_github("constantinoantunes/rhwsd")

```

## A quick example:


This example uses the get.hwsd.latlon function, which builds a box on the provided coordinates with a grid size of 0.1:

```r

library(hwsd)

con = get.hwsd.con("data/HWSD.sqlite3")
lat = 51.528308
lon = -0.3817805

get.hwsd.latlon(lat, lon, con=con, hwsd.bil="data/HWSD_RASTER/hwsd.bil")

```
